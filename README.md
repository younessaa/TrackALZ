======= Update your path ========
If you wish to run Flutter commands in the regular Windows console, take these steps to add Flutter to the PATH environment variable:

From the Start search bar, enter ‘env’ and select Edit environment variables for your account.
Under User variables check if there is an entry called Path:
If the entry exists, append the full path to flutter\bin using ; as a separator from existing values.
If the entry doesn’t exist, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\bin as its value.
